# Task ID: 5
# Title: Time Clock Integration and Attendance Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multi-device time tracking integration with HIKVISION, ZKTecho support and sophisticated attendance calculations
# Details:
Build time clock data import system supporting HIKVISION CSV format and ZKTecho database connections. Implement attendance processing engine with progressive overtime calculations (115%→140%→150%→200% rates), night shift premiums after 22:00, holiday premium processing (50% and 100% rates), and working days calculation for salary prorating. Create 21-field work schedule matrix management for individual employee patterns. Build leave management system with accrual tracking and approval workflows. Implement real-time attendance monitoring dashboard with exception reporting for missing punches and anomalies.

# Test Strategy:
Test time clock import from sample CSV files, verify overtime calculations match business rules, confirm night shift and holiday premiums calculate correctly, test leave request workflow, validate work schedule patterns affect calculations properly, and ensure attendance exception reports identify issues accurately
