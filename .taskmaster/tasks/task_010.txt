# Task ID: 10
# Title: System Administration and Advanced Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive system configuration, bulk operations, license management, and performance optimization
# Details:
Build system administration interface for configuring 81+ payroll parameters including tax rates, overtime rules, allowance scales, and automation settings. Implement bulk operations system for mass employee updates, salary adjustments, and data corrections with progress tracking and rollback capabilities. Create license management system with employee count limits and feature restrictions based on license type. Add performance optimization including database indexing, query optimization, and caching strategies. Implement data backup and recovery procedures with automated scheduling. Build system monitoring dashboard with performance metrics and health checks. Add multi-language localization support with currency formatting for MRU (Mauritanian Ouguiya).

# Test Strategy:
Test system parameter configuration affects calculations correctly, verify bulk operations process large datasets efficiently, confirm license restrictions enforce properly, validate performance optimizations improve response times, test backup and recovery procedures work reliably, ensure monitoring dashboard shows accurate system health, and verify localization displays proper currency and date formats
