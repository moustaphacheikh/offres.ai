# Task ID: 6
# Title: Advanced Payroll Calculation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement sophisticated payroll processing with 25+ built-in functions, tax calculations, and multi-motif processing
# Details:
Build payroll calculation engine with 25+ built-in functions (F01-F25) including seniority calculations, daily/hourly salary computations, severance calculations, and regional minimum wage functions. Implement progressive ITS tax calculations with three tranches (15%/20%/25% for nationals, 7.5%/20%/25% for expatriates), CNSS calculations with 15,000 MRU ceiling, and CNAM calculations (uncapped). Create multi-motif payroll processing supporting different payment types (regular salary, leave pay, bonuses). Implement formula evaluation engine with mathematical expression parsing and cross-references to other payroll elements. Add payroll validation rules for minimum wage compliance and social security ceilings.

# Test Strategy:
Test all 25+ payroll functions with sample data, verify tax calculations match Mauritanian regulations, confirm multi-motif processing handles different payment types correctly, validate formula engine evaluates expressions accurately, and ensure payroll validation prevents compliance violations
