# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication and User Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure authentication system with role-based access control and proper password security
# Details:
Extend Django's AbstractUser to create custom User model with 22 module-specific permission flags (can_access_personnel, can_access_payroll, can_access_attendance, etc.). Implement secure password hashing using Django's default PBKDF2, add login/logout views with proper session management, create role-based access control decorators, and implement user management interface for creating/modifying user accounts. Add password complexity requirements and account lockout after failed attempts. Remove any hardcoded credentials and implement proper authentication flow.

# Test Strategy:
Test user creation, login/logout functionality, verify permission system restricts access correctly, confirm password security meets standards, test session management, and validate role-based access control works across all modules

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend Django AbstractUser with Custom User Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create custom User model extending AbstractUser with 22 module-specific permission flags
### Details:
Extend Django's AbstractUser to create custom User model with boolean fields for 22 permission flags (can_access_personnel, can_access_payroll, can_access_attendance, etc.). Configure AUTH_USER_MODEL setting and create initial migration. Include proper field definitions and model metadata.

## 2. Implement Password Security and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up secure password hashing, complexity requirements, and validation rules
### Details:
Configure Django's PBKDF2 password hashing (default), implement password complexity validators (minimum length, character requirements, common password checks), create custom password validation logic, and ensure secure password storage practices.

## 3. Create Authentication Views and Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build login/logout views with proper session management and user interface
### Details:
Create login and logout views using Django's authentication system, implement proper session management, design login templates with security features, handle authentication success/failure redirects, and ensure CSRF protection is properly configured.

## 4. Implement Role-Based Access Control Decorators [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create permission decorators and middleware for role-based access control
### Details:
Build custom decorators that check user permissions based on the 22 permission flags, create middleware for automatic permission checking, implement view-level access control, and ensure proper permission inheritance and validation across all modules.

## 5. Build User Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.4
### Description: Create administrative interface for user account creation and modification
### Details:
Develop user management views for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts, build forms for user permission management, implement user search and filtering capabilities, create user role assignment interface, and ensure proper validation and security checks.

## 6. Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add account lockout functionality after failed login attempts
### Details:
Create login attempt tracking system, implement automatic account lockout after configurable failed attempts, add account unlock functionality for administrators, create lockout notification system, and implement progressive delay mechanisms for failed attempts.

## 7. Create Permission-Based Menu System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Build dynamic menu system that shows options based on user permissions
### Details:
Develop template tags and context processors for permission-based menu rendering, create navigation templates that dynamically show/hide menu items based on user permissions, implement breadcrumb system with permission awareness, and ensure consistent navigation experience across all modules.

## 8. Remove Hardcoded Credentials and Implement Security Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Eliminate hardcoded credentials and conduct comprehensive security review
### Details:
Scan codebase for hardcoded credentials and remove them, implement proper environment variable configuration for sensitive settings, create security audit checklist, test authentication flow end-to-end, verify all security measures are working correctly, and document security procedures.
