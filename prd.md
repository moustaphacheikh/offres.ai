- **Performance Analytics**: Employee statistics by age, gender, department
- **Cost Center Analysis**: Department-wise payroll cost allocation
- **Budget Variance**: Actual vs. planned payroll expense analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Multi-period comparative payroll analytics

### Conditional Logic
- **Overtime Rate Progression**: Based on cumulative hours worked: 115% (hours 1-8) → 140% (hours 9-14) → 150% (hours 15+) → 200% (holiday work)
- **Tax Treatment Variations**: 
  - Nationals vs. expatriates have different ITS rates (15% vs 7.5% in first tranche)
  - Detached employees may be exempt from social security contributions
  - Government employees receive special employer reimbursements
- **Leave Calculation Rules**: 
  - Accrual rates vary by service length and employee category
  - Leave pay calculations differ by leave type (vacation, sick, special)
  - Leave during payroll period affects working days calculation
- **Allowance Calculations**: 
  - Family allowances based on number of children and marital status
  - Housing allowances vary by salary grade and family situation
  - Transport allowances based on work location and distance
  - Meal allowances calculated by actual working days

### State Transitions
- **Employee Status**: Active → On Leave → Terminated
- **Payroll Status**: Draft → Calculated → Approved → Paid → Closed
- **Report Status**: Generated → Reviewed → Submitted → Archived

## 5. Data Relationships (User Perspective)

### Core Business Entities Users Work With

#### **Employee Records (37+ related data types)**
- **Employee Master**: Central record with 72 fields including personal, employment, and configuration data
- **Family Information**: Spouse and children records affecting allowance calculations
- **Employment History**: Engagement tracking with dates, reasons, and documentation
- **Leave Records**: Vacation, sick leave, and special leave with balance tracking
- **Time Records**: Daily attendance, overtime hours, and schedule variations
- **Payroll History**: All salary calculations, deductions, and net pay by period
- **Document Attachments**: Contracts, certificates, photos, and legal documents

#### **Organizational Structure**
- **General Directions**: Top-level organizational divisions
- **Directions**: Mid-level departments and business units
- **Departments**: Operational units for cost tracking and reporting
- **Positions**: Job roles and responsibilities affecting compensation
- **Activities**: Work classifications for cost center analysis

#### **Payroll Configuration**
- **Pay Elements (Rubriques)**: Configurable salary components with calculation formulas
- **Formula Components**: Mathematical expressions using 24 built-in functions
- **Tax Parameters**: CNSS, CNAM, and ITS rates and ceilings
- **Allowance Scales**: Housing, family, and other benefit grids
- **Deduction Schedules**: Installment plans for advances and loans

#### **Financial Integration**
- **Banking Information**: Multi-bank support with account validation
- **Accounting Entries**: Journal entries with master/detail structure (58-field UNL format)
- **Payment Files**: Electronic transfer files for various banking systems
- **Cost Centers**: Organizational cost allocation and tracking

### Key Business Relationships

#### **Employee-Centric Relationships**
- **Employee → Organizational Assignment**: Each employee belongs to exactly one department, direction, and position
- **Employee → Payroll Calculations**: Multiple payroll records per employee (by period and motif)
- **Employee → Time Records**: Daily attendance and weekly overtime tracking
- **Employee → Leave Management**: Leave requests, balances, and usage history
- **Employee → Financial Data**: Banking details, installment deductions, and payment history

#### **Payroll Processing Relationships**
- **Payroll Period → Employee Calculations**: Each period contains payroll calculations for all active employees
- **Pay Elements → Formulas**: Each payroll component uses configurable calculation formulas
- **Attendance → Payroll**: Time data directly feeds into salary and overtime calculations
- **Organizational Structure → Cost Allocation**: Department assignments drive cost center reporting

#### **Compliance and Reporting Relationships**
- **Payroll Data → Tax Declarations**: Aggregated payroll feeds into CNSS, CNAM, and ITS reports
- **Employee Classification → Tax Treatment**: Employee status affects tax calculation methods
- **Time Records → Compliance**: Attendance data supports labor regulation compliance
- **Financial Records → Accounting**: Payroll generates accounting entries and bank transfers

### Business Constraints and Rules

#### **Data Integrity Constraints**
- **Unique Employee IDs**: No duplicate employee identification numbers across the system
- **Period Uniqueness**: No overlapping payroll periods for the same employee and motif
- **Social Security Numbers**: CNSS and CNAM numbers must be unique and properly formatted
- **Bank Account Validation**: Account numbers validated against bank routing codes before payment
- **Formula Validation**: Payroll formulas must be mathematically valid and avoid circular references

#### **Business Logic Constraints**
- **Minimum Wage Compliance**: All salary calculations must meet or exceed SMIG requirements
- **Tax Ceiling Enforcement**: Social security contributions respect maximum contribution limits
- **Leave Balance Management**: Leave usage cannot exceed accrued balances
- **Work Hour Limits**: Daily and weekly work hours must comply with labor regulations
- **Currency Precision**: All monetary calculations rounded to appropriate currency precision

#### **Temporal Constraints**
- **Employment Dates**: Hire date must precede termination date
- **Payroll Sequence**: Payroll calculations must follow chronological order
- **Leave Periods**: Leave dates must fall within employment period
- **Document Validity**: Passport, visa, and permit dates must be current for expatriate employees

#### **Access and Security Constraints**
- **Role-Based Access**: User permissions determine available functions and data access
- **Data Privacy**: Salary and personal information restricted based on user authorization
- **Audit Requirements**: All data modifications must be logged with user and timestamp
- **License Compliance**: System functionality limited by license terms and user count
